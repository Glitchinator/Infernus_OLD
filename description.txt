Infernus Mod

Infernus Mod is a medium sized content mod to add on and to make your terraria playthrough faster and easier. However, Infernus Mod is a challenging mod. Infernus Mod has a plethora of quality of life addons and is compatible with
Boss Checklist. The bosses are hard and there is a gamemode that makes the bosses harder. This mod is not for the weak. Currently in total I have made around 400-ish additions/changes,
but if you want specifices you can look below.

+ If you have any thoughts about the mod please join the discord to share them.
